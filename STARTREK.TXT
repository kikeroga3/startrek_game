			STARTREK

THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF LYNN COCHRAN'S  STARTREK (PUBLISHED IN
THE JUNE 1976 ISSUE OF SCCS INTERFACE).  IT IS CODED IN TINY BASIC
(PALO ALTO VERSION) AND THUS TAKES LESS MEMORY (8K INSTEAD OF 12K)
AND IS FASTER (4 SECONDS TO SET UP THE GALAXY MOST OF THE TIME,
INSTEAD OF 10 SECONDS).  IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM LYNN'S VERSION:

(1) COMMANDS ARE GIVEN IN WORDS INSTEAD OF NUMBERS.  

	W OR WARP FOR WARP ENGINE
	T OR TORPEDO FOR PHOTON TORPEDO
	P OR PHASER FOR PHASERS
	S OR SHORT FOR SHORT RANGE SCAN
	L OR LONG FOR LONG RANGE SCAN
	G OR GALAXY FOR GALAXY MAP

(2) THERE IS ONE MORE COMMAND: 'REPORT' OR 'R' WHICH PRINTS OUT 
PERTINENT INFORMATION (INCLUDING DAMAGES).

(3) DIRECTION (OR COURSE) IS GIVEN IN DEGREES (0 FOR NORTH, 90 FOR
EAST, 180 FOR SOUTH, AND 270 FOR WEST), AND DISTANCE (OR WARPS) IS
GIVEN IN UNITS OF SECTORS.  BOTH MUST BE INTEGERS.

(4) THE WARP ENGINE HAS BETTER CONTROLS NOW.  YOU CAN MOVE PRECISLY
TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO, EVEN AFTER CROSSING THE QUADRANT BOUNDARY.
IT STILL TAKES 1 STARDATE TO MAKE A MOVE, BUT FOR LONG DISTANCE MOVES
YOU WILL BURN A DISPROPORTIONALLY LARGE AMOUNT OF ENERGY.

(5) WHEN KLINGONS FIRE AT YOU, YOU COULD GET HURT NOW.  (IN LYNN'S
VERSION, THEY CANNOT DAMAGE YOU, AND THEY DEPLETE THEIR OWN ENERGY MORE
THAN YOURS.)  SO, DON'T TRY TO SIT THERE AND WEAR THEM OUT.

(6) IF YOU HIT A KLINGON WITH YOUT PHOTON TORPEDO, THE KLINGON MIGHT NOT
GET TOTALLY DESTROYED.  ALSO, IF YOU HIT A STAR, IT MIGHT NOT GET 
EFFECTED AT ALL.  WHEN A STAR IS DESTROYED, IT MIGHT NOVA AND THE 
RADIATION WILL HURT YOU.

(7) ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, YOU GET MORE ENERGY (4000 UNITS) AT EACH
DOCKING, AND YOU ARE WELL PROTECTED BY YOUR SHIIELD.  YOU NEVER GET HURT
UNLESS THE SHIELD IS DAMAGED.

THE GALAXY CONSISTS OF 64 QUADRANTS IN AN 8 BY 8 ARRAY.  EACH QUADRANT
CONSISTS OF 64 SECTORS IN AN 8 BY 8 ARRAY.  WHEN YOU MOVE YOU GIVE
THE NUMBER OF SECTORS YOU WISH TO MOVE.  THAT IS, 3 QUADRANTS WOULD
BE 24 SECTORS (8 SECTORS X 3 QUADRANTS).
